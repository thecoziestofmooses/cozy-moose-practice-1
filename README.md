        <p>I met an octopus yesterday. He was no ordinary octopus. He was <em>magical.</em> These are some of the unusual things he could do:</p>
        <li>Sing</li>
        <li>Ballroom Dance</li>
        <li>Control People's Dreams</li>
        <li>Speak to Capyberas</li>
        
        <p>I was so facinated by him, I decided to look up regular octopi online and I learned so much! They are incredibly smart. They can squeeze through very tiny spaces. They also have a beak like a bird. It doesn't surprise me that one of them has become so advanced and gained magical powers!</p>

        <p>My dog, Piper, met a friend today. It was another dog name Juno. They both had their own traits, talants and weaknesses. I've made a chart below showing some of their traits:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Dog</th>
                    <th>Color</th>
                    <th>Size</th>
                    <th>Gender</th>
                    <th>Strength</th>
                    <th>Weakness</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Piper</td>
                    <td>White/Brown</td>
                    <td>13lbs</td>
                    <td>Female</td>
                    <td>Army-Crawl</td>
                    <td>Anxiety</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Juno</td>
                    <td>Black/Brown</td>
                    <td>20lbs</td>
                    <td>Female</td>
                    <td>Super Fast</td>
                    <td>Slobbers</td>
                </tr>
                
            </thead>
        </table>
        
        <p>Conclusion: The only thing they have in common is that they are both girls! And yet, they are still good friends.</p>

        <p>I went to the moon yesterday, just like Wallace and Grommit. I collected a bunch of cheese and now have so much! Here's a song about cheese:</p>
        <p class="cheese-song">Cheese is a kind of meat<br>A tasty yellow beef<br>I milk it from my teat<br>But I try to be discreet<br>Ooh cheese, ooh cheese</p>
